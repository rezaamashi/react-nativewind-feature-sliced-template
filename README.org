#+title: Barebone React Native Feature Sliced Design Template

* What is this repo?
This repo is my personal template for React Native project with Expo and Nativewind following the Feature-Sliced Design principle.

* Why I make this?
After fighting with Nativewind for an hour, showing ~no-data~ error (Looking at you ~metro~)[fn:1] . I decided that it is best for me to just go with the barebone and making the template myself since it is a lot more easier to start new project directly.

* What are the things that  configured in this template?
- ~babel-module-resolver~
- ~@feature-sliced/eslint-config~ (allowing import from segment[fn:2])
- ~nativewind~

* Usage
To start using this repo just clone it and run ~pnpm install~ (or any package manager of your choice)
#+begin_src bash
pnpm install;
pnpm prebuild; # or use pbi for ios and pba for android
#+end_src

Start developing on your selected platform
#+begin_src bash
pnpm ios
# or
pnpm android
#+end_src

[fn:1] At the time of writing this I was still unable to find the culprit.
